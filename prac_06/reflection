# Reflection

What did I learn from this practical?
- I learned how to create and use classes in Python to encapsulate data and functionality, which helps in organizing code more effectively.

What was challenging?
- I found it challenging to implement the testing methods correctly to ensure they returned the expected results, as debugging required careful attention to detail.

How can I improve in the future?
- I can improve by practicing more coding exercises and focusing on writing test cases to ensure my code functions as intended before running the main program.
