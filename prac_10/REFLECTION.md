# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Initially, my estimates were often off. I tended to underestimate the time required for understanding new concepts and debugging code.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, my estimates became more accurate as I learned to account for challenges like debugging and researching unfamiliar topics. Experience taught me to include buffer time for unexpected issues.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of planning and breaking down tasks into smaller parts. It also helped me prioritize tasks and manage my time effectively.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed taught me to view my code through the lens of clarity and maintainability. Feedback often highlighted areas I thought were fine but could be improved for better readability or performance.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing othersâ€™ code helped me understand different approaches to the same problem. It also reinforced best practices and allowed me to spot patterns of errors, which improved my own coding.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

Unfortunately, I have not received feedback or recognition for any code reviews I have performed. However, I have included a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate my understanding of what makes a good code review.

### Explanation

In a hypothetical review, I would focus on:
- Identifying redundant or overly complex code and suggesting simplifications.
- Encouraging the use of meaningful variable and function names for better readability.
- Providing constructive feedback with specific examples of how the code could be improved.
- Highlighting areas where test coverage could be enhanced to ensure the code handles edge cases.

### Good Code Review 2

I have not conducted any code reviews for which I received feedback. However, here is another hypothetical example to showcase my approach.

### Explanation

In this scenario, I would:
- Suggest modularizing large functions into smaller, single-purpose ones to improve maintainability.
- Recommend adding docstrings and comments to clarify the purpose of functions and variables.
- Encourage the developer to adhere to coding standards and best practices, such as consistent formatting and indentation.
- Acknowledge good practices observed in the code, such as efficient algorithms or clear logic.

If I had received proper feedback, it would have helped me refine my approach further, but I have done my best to engage critically with my own and others' code when possible.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include more real-world scenarios and examples to show how the concepts apply outside the classroom. Adding optional challenge tasks for advanced learners could also help stretch their skills.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I consistently completed the tasks on time and ensured my code followed best practices, including proper formatting, clear variable names, and meaningful comments. I also made an effort to review my work critically before submission.
